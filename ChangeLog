** Denotes major changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Working on

    ** Additive models estimation with the same approach (with repeated data).
    ** Different parameterization for change-points estimation.
    ** Estimation using vectorized matrices (with repeated data).
    * Add vignette explaining better its use.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-02-13

### Added

    * Improved verbosity during computation.
    * Allows repeated or spatially close observations.
    ** Alternative penalties.

### Changed

    ** Improved version of planarity test for surfaces.
    * Example using imported landim1 data taken from geoR.

### Removed

    * Dependency on geoR package.

## [1.0.2] - 2017-06-20

### Changed

    * Fix to verbosity during estimation.

## [1.0.1] - 2017-05-17

### Added

    * Fit surfaces, parametric components and semivariograms using smoothing splines.
    * Add change-points and/or contours of change to the model.
    * Test planarity for surfaces.
    * Example using landim1 data from geoR.
