The R package scpm is intended for surface smoothing in semiparametric models and
estimation of change-points for covariates in the parametric component and contours
of change in the surface component.

R package scpm allows to estimate surfaces using smoothing splines to small to
middle size datasets. For larger datasets it will depend on the nature of the data
and system resources. For scattered data estimation takes significantly longer
as the data size increases. Therefore use it carefully.

Currently under development.
